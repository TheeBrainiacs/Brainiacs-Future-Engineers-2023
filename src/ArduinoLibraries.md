The following Arduino libraries were used in this project. All the used libraries are free, open-source, and can be downloaded using the internal
Arduino libarary manager.


* `Adafruit_TCS34725.h` Used to control the color sensor.
* `Wire.h` Used to interface Arduino and Jetson NANO using SDA/SCL. This library comes pre-installed with the arduino launcher.
* `MPU6050_tockn.h` Used to control and calibrate the Gyroscope.
* `Servo.h` Used to control the servo motor used for the steering mechanism.
